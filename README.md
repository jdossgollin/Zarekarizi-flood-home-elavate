Elevating a building is a common approach to manage flood risks. Homeowners need to decide if and how much to elevate a building. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides a general recommendation of elevating the building to at least the Base Flood Elevation plus a freeboard. This raises the question: what is an economically optimal house elevation decision in the face of uncertain flood projections? Here we present a cost-benefit analysis under uncertainty and compare the results with FEMA’s recommendation. We analyzed four main strategies: (1) repairing as floods occur, (2) lifting the house to FEMA’s minimum recommendation, (3) elevating the house to a cost-optimal elevation that minimizes the total cost (current cost of elevating plus net present value of expected damages), and (4) elevating the building to the optimal elevation under uncertainty. We show that the economically optimal elevation typically increases if uncertainty in flood hazard is considered.  Furthermore,  the strategy to elevate to FEMA’s recommendation can often be improved on from a cost-benefit perspective.
